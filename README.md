James Still (April 9, 1812 â€“ March 9, 1882) was an African-American physician, herbalist, and author. He was known as "The Black Doctor of the Pines", referring to the New Jersey Pine Barrens region. His parents were slaves and he was born into poverty, yet with a minimum of formal education and much hard work and self-education, Still became a successful and much-respected doctor in the southern New Jersey and Philadelphia areas. He chronicled his life in an autobiography, Early Recollections and Life of Dr. James Still, printed by J.B. Lippincott and Co. in 1877.
